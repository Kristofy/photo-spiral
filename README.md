# PhotoSpiral

Hi! This is a simple tool to help you turn your photos into fun spiral layouts. It's great for making little prints for your wallet, scrapbooks, or gifts.

## How to use it

1.  Open `index.html` in your browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.).
2.  Click **Add Images** and pick the photos you want to print.
3.  Play around with the settings until you like how it looks.
4.  Click **Download ZIP** to get your printable sheets.

## Printing Tips

*   **Size**: The sheets are 15x15cm.
*   **Card Size**: The individual photos are sized like a standard credit card (8.6 x 5.4 cm).
*   **Settings**: Make sure to print at **100% Scale** (or "Actual Size") so they come out the right size.
*   **Cutting**: Turn on "Show Cut Outlines" if you want lines to help you cut them out.

## Just a heads up

This project is just for personal use. Have fun with it!
